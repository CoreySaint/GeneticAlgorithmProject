# GeneticAlgorithmProject
This is a project for my Artificial Intelligence course. This course explores NP-complete problems, specifically the decision version of the longest path problem, and using Genetic Algorithms along with a Wisdom of Crowds heuristic to create a long path through vertices on a graph.
