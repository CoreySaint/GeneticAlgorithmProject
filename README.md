# GeneticAlgorithmProject
This is a project for my Artificial Intelligence course. This course explores NP-complete problems, specifically the decision version of the longest path problem, and using Genetic Algorithms along with a Wisdom of Crowds heuristic to create a long path through vertices on a graph.
Included in this repository is the python code for the algorithm, various input files tested, and an IEEE formatted paper discussing the results of the experiment.
